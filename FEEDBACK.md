# Part One - Intro to OO
Classes look clean. Feel free to add more comments that help us see how you're thinking about the different tools. Since you're comfortable creating the classes, make sure you're using the run.rb file to create instances and test the classes you've written.

^^ Wrote this last night and then saw your updates; good job!!

# Part Two
Classes look clean and concise. All deliverables met. You have a solid understanding, and I reccomend working on building out your own methods and adding some new functionalities outside of the deliverables! Great job on the CLI interface too!
