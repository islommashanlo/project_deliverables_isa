# Part One - Intro to OO
Classes look clean. Feel free to add more comments that help us see how you're thinking about the different tools. Since you're comfortable creating the classes, make sure you're using the run.rb file to create instances and test the classes you've written.

^^ Wrote this last night and then saw your updates; good job!!

# Part Two
Classes look clean and concise. All deliverables met. You have a solid understanding, and I reccomend working on building out your own methods and adding some new functionalities outside of the deliverables! Great job on the CLI interface too! 

# Part Four - Associations
- Nitpicky: file names should be lowercase! This will matter when you get to rails :) The model files should also be singular ie `doctor.rb`
- Doctor class looks good but... is `Doctor#patients` guaranteed not to include duplicates..?
- Ooooohhhh you made it so patients could only book one appointment with a Doctor. I like that you figured out how to do that but... I like to go back to the same doctor :(
- I love this method `list_pat_doctors`
- Moving quickly through these but there's so much in your `run.rb` file! Good for you!!! One thing to start doing is pull some of that code from your `run` method into helper methods that you can invoke when the user selects the right option.
